Files Lab: If there is time.

Files Lab
In the class repo, in:

Examples\Session01\students.txt

You will find the list I generated of all the students in the class, and what programming languages they have used in the past.

Write a little script that reads that file, and generates a list of all the languages that have been used.

Extra credit: keep track of how many students specified each language.
